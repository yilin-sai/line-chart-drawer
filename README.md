# line-chart-drawer

A React hook to draw connecting lines between elements to form a line chart.

---

## ‚ú® Use Case

Why another line drawer when there are so many charting libraries?

`line-chart-drawer` allows you to draw lines connecting arbitrary DOM elements in your UI. This means your line chart can be seamlessly embedded into other UI components with much more flexibility. For example, you can show a line chart inside a table:

![Line Chart Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yilin-sai/line-chart-drawer/refs/heads/main/docs/example.png "Line Chart Example")

In the example above, the data points are drawn using a charting library (e.g., `recharts`), while `line-chart-drawer` is used to connect the data points. See the [App.tsx](https://github.com/yilin-sai/line-chart-drawer/blob/main/demo/src/App.tsx) file for the implementation.

### Features:
- **Flexibility**: Draw embedded line charts by connecting arbitrary DOM elements.
- **Customizable Styles**: Configure line color, stroke width, dashed lines, and more.
- **Responsiveness**: Automatically redraw lines on window resize or other events.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install line-chart-drawer
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Basic Usage:
```tsx
const { redrawLine } = useLineDrawer("data-point", "chart-container", { color: "#00AEEF" });

useEffect(() => {
  redrawLine(); // Redraw the lines on every re-render. This is optional.
});
```

By default, the lines will be redrawn on window resize.

### 2. Customize Stroke Styles:
```tsx
const { redrawLine } = useLineDrawer("data-point", "chart-container", { 
  color: "#00AEEF", 
  strokeWidth: 4, 
  dashed: true 
});
```
